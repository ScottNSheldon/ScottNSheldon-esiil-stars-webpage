Hello! My name is Scott Sheldon and I am a senior majoring in Environmental Science with a minor in Biology at MSU Denver. I was born and raised in Golden, CO and have lived around Denver my entire life. When I am not busy with working on school or at my job as a chemistry technician in environmental proficiency testing and quality control, I tend to spend my time relaxing. That could mean going for a walk on a trail, listening to a plethora of podcasts I enjoy, or endlessly scrolling through TikTok.

As an ESIIL Stars intern, I excited to learn how to use Python to process real world data. Beyond MySpace days, I haven't ever coded before and I'm intrigued on its application to data sets. I'm also excited to be able to contribute to a team to look at real world data and make sense of it! I find it so cool that there is so much environmental data out there ready to be analyzed.
